    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Adobo is a popular Filipino dish known for its unique blend of savory, tangy, and often slightly sweet flavors. It's essentially a stew where meat (usually chicken or pork).</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>peppercorn</li>
        <li>Pork or Chicked</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by choosing a pot that’s big enough to fit the chicken and pork adobo. Bring the pot to medium high heat and sauté the garlic and onions in hot oil.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces into the pot and sear on all sides. Searing means to brown the meat in high heat. This adds flavour and color to the meat. Make sure that the meat pieces are not wet or you will not achieve the desired color you are looking for. You can do this in batches so you do not overcrowd the pot because the juices from the meat will run out and thus prevent the browning effect of the meat. Add the pork and sear as well.</li>
        <li>The next step is to pour the vinegar, soy sauce, bay leaves, pepper, water, Knorr Chicken Cube. Bring this up to a boil over high heat then lower the fire to a simmer. Do not cover your pot or you will end up with a raw vinegar taste. This will take about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>For a more flavour-filled adobo, remove the chicken and pork pieces from the pot and fry this separately in another pan for about 2-3 minutes. When done, throw in the fried meat pieces into the pot, add the sugar and simmer for another 6 minutes or until the sauce has reached a syrup-like consistency. To add fiber into your dish, add sliced Bok-Choi last and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>The dish is now ready to be enjoyed by the whole family with a bowl of steaming rice.</li>
